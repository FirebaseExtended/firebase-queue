## Purpose of a Queue

Queues can be used in your Firebase app to organize workers or perform background work like generating thumbnails of images, filtering message contents and censoring data, or fanning data out to multiple locations in your Firebase database. First, let's define a few terms we'll use when talking about a queue:
  - `task` - a unit of work that a queue worker can process
  - `spec` - a definition of an operation that the queue will perform on matching tasks
  - `job` - one or more `spec`'s that specify a series of ordered operations to be performed
  - `worker` - an individual process that picks up tasks with a certain spec and processes them

Let's take a look at a simple example to see how this works. Imagine you wanted to build a chat application that does two things:
  1. Sanitize chat message input
  2. Fan data out to multiple rooms and users

Since chat message sanitization can't happen purely on the client side, as that would allow a malicious client to circumvent client side restrictions, you'll have to run this process on a trusted server process.

Using Firebase Queue, you can create specs for each of these tasks, and then use workers to process the individual tasks to complete the job. We'll explore the queue, adding tasks, assigning workers, and creating custom specs to create full jobs, then [revisit the example](#message-sanitization-revisited) above.

## The Queue in Your Firebase Database

The queue relies on having a Firebase database reference to coordinate workers e.g. `https://databaseName.firebaseio.com/queue`. This queue can be stored at any path in your Firebase database, and you can have multiple queues as well. The queue will respond to tasks pushed onto the `tasks` subtree and optionally read specifications from a `specs` subtree.

```
queue
  - specs
  - tasks
```

See [Custom references to tasks and specs](#custom-references-to-tasks-and-specs) for defining the locations of these other than the default.

Firebase Queue works with a Firebase database reference from either the [firebase-admin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-admin) (for admin access) or [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) (for end-user access) NPM module, though it is mainly intended to perform administrative actions. Check out [this blog post](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/11/bringing-firebase-to-your-server.html) for an introduction to firebase-admin.


## Queue Workers

The basic unit of the queue is the queue worker: the function that claims a task, performs the appropriate processing on the data, and either returns the transformed data, or an appropriate error.

You can start a worker process by passing in a Firebase database  [`ref`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/server/setup#initialize_the_sdk) along with a processing function ([described below](#the-processing-function)), as follows:

```js
// my_queue_worker.js

var Queue = require('firebase-queue');
var admin = require('firebase-admin');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert('path/to/serviceAccountCredentials.json'),
  databaseURL: '<your-database-url>'
});

var ref = admin.database().ref('queue');
var queue = new Queue(ref, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  // Read and process task data
  console.log(data);

  // Do some work
  progress(50);

  // Finish the task asynchronously
  setTimeout(function() {
    resolve();
  }, 1000);
});
```

```shell
node my_queue_worker.js
```

Multiple queue workers can be initialized on multiple machines and Firebase-Queue will ensure that only one worker is processing a single queue task at a time.


#### Queue Worker Options (Optional)

Queue workers can take an optional options object to specify:
  - `specId` - specifies the spec type for this worker. This is important when creating multiple specs. Defaults to `null` which uses the default spec.
  - `numWorkers` - specifies the number of initial workers to run simultaneously on a single node.js thread. Defaults to 1 worker, and can be updated once the queue has been initialized (see the [Dynamic Worker Count](#dynamic-worker-count) section).
  - `sanitize` - specifies whether the `data` object passed to the processing function is sanitized of internal keys reserved for use by the queue. Defaults to `true`.
  - `suppressStack` - specifies whether the queue will suppress error stack traces from being placed in the `_error_details` of the task if it's rejected with an Error.

```js
...

var options = {
  'specId': 'spec_1',
  'numWorkers': 5,
  'sanitize': false,
  'suppressStack': true
};
var queue = new Queue(ref, options, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  ...
});
```


## Pushing Tasks Onto the Queue

Using any Firebase client or the REST API, push an object with some data to the `tasks` subtree of your queue. Queue workers listening on that subtree will automatically pick up and process the new task.

```shell
# Using curl in shell
curl -X POST -d '{"foo": "bar"}' https://databaseName.firebaseio.com/queue/tasks.json
```
or
```js
// Using the web JavaScript client
var ref = firebase.database().ref('queue/tasks');
ref.push({'foo': 'bar'});
```

### Starting Tasks in Specific States (Optional)

When using a custom spec, you can pass a `_state` key in with your object, which will allow a custom spec's worker(s) to pick up your task at a specific spec, rather than starting with the starting spec.

```js
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "boo": "baz",
  "_state": "spec_n_start"
}
```


## The Processing Function

The processing function provides the body of the data transformation, and allows for completing tasks successfully or with error conditions, as well as reporting the progress of a task. As this function defines the work that the worker must do, this callback function is required. It should take the following four parameters:

#### `data`

A JavaScript object containing the claimed task's data, and can contain any keys and values with the exception of several reserved keys, which are used for tracking worker progress.

The reserved keys are:
 - `_state` - The current state of the task. Will always be the task's `in_progress_state` when passed to the processing function.
 - `_state_changed` - The timestamp that the task changed into its current state. This will always be the server time when the processing function was called.
 - `_owner` - A unique ID for the worker and task number combination to ensure only one worker is responsible for the task at any time.
 - `_progress` - A number between 0 and 100, reset at the start of each task to 0.
 - `_error_details` - An object containing the error details from a previous task execution. If present, it may contain a `previous_state` string (or `null` if there was no previous state, in the case of malformed input) capturing the state the task was in when it errored, an `error` string from the `reject()` callback of the previous task, and an `attempts` field containing the number of retries attempted before failing a task. If the `suppressStack` queue option is not set to `true`, there may also be a `error_stack` field containg a stack dump of any error passed into the `reject()` function.
 - `_id` - The Firebase key of the task.

 By default the data is sanitized of these keys, but you can disable this behavior by setting `'sanitize': false` in the [queue options](#queue-worker-options-optional).

#### `progress()`

A callback function for reporting the progress of the task. `progress()` takes a single parameter that must be a number between 0 and 100, and returns a [RSVP.Promise](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js) that's fulfilled when successfully updated. If this promise is rejected, it's likely that the task is no longer owned by this process (perhaps it has timed out or the task specification has changed) or the worker has lost its connection to Firebase.

By catching when this call fails and cancelling the current task early, the worker can minimize the extra work it does and return to processing new queue tasks sooner:

```js
...
var queue = new Queue(ref, options, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  ...
  function stopProcessing() {
    ...
  }
  ...
  // report current progress
  progress(currentProgress).catch(function(errorMessage) {
    // we've lost the current task, so stop processing
    stopProcessing();

    // and reject the task so that we can pick up new tasks
    reject(errorMessage);
  });
  ...
});
```

#### `resolve()`

A callback function for reporting that the current task has been completed and the worker is ready to process another task. Any plain JavaScript object passed into the `resolve()` function will be written to the `tasks` location and will be available to the next task if the tasks are chained. When a task is resolved, the `_progress` field is updated to 100 and the `_state` is replaced with either the `_new_state` key of the object passed in, or the `finished_state` of the task spec. If the task does not have a `finished_state` or the `_new_state` key is set to `false`, the task will be removed from the queue.

#### `reject()`

A callback function for reporting that the current task failed and the worker is ready to process another task. Once this is called, the task will go into the `error_state` for the job with an additional `_error_details` object containing a `previous_state` key referencing this task's `in_progress_state`. If a string is passed into the `reject()` function, the `_error_details` will also contain an `error` key containing that string. If an Error is passed into the `reject()` function, the `error` key will contain the `error.message`, and if `suppressStack` option has not been specified the `error_stack` key will contain the `error.stack`. Note that if retries are enabled and there are remaining attempts, the task will be restarted in it's spec's `start_state`.


## Queue Security

Securing your queue is an important step in securely processing events that come in. Below is a sample set of security rules that can be tailored to your particular use case.

In this example, there are three categories of users, represented using fields of a [Database Auth Variable Override](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/server/start#authenticate-with-limited-privileges):
- `auth.canAddTasks`: Users who can add tasks to the queue (could be an authenticated client or a secure server)
- `auth.canProcessTasks`: Users who can process tasks (usually on a secure server)
- `auth.canAddSpecs`: Users who can create and view task specifications (usually on a secure server)

These don't have to use a custom token, for instance you could use `auth != null` in place of `auth.canAddTasks` if application's users can write directly to the queue. Similarly, `auth.canProcessTasks` and `auth.canAddSpecs` could be `auth.admin === true` if a single trusted server process was used to perform all queue functions.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "queue": {
      "tasks": {
        ".read": "auth.canProcessTasks",
        ".write": "auth.canAddTasks || auth.canProcessTasks",
        ".indexOn": "_state",
        "$taskId": {
          ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['property_1', ..., 'property_n'])
                        || (auth.canProcessTasks
                        && newData.hasChildren(['_state', '_state_changed', '_progress']))",
          "_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "_state_changed": {
            ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && (newData.val() === now
                          || data.val() === newData.val())"
          },
          "_owner": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "_progress": {
            ".validate": "newData.isNumber()
                          && newData.val() >= 0
                          && newData.val() <= 100"
          },
          "_error_details": {
              "error": {
                ".validate": "newData.isString()"
              },

              "original_task": {

              },

                ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && newData.val() > 0"
              },
              "$other": {
                ".validate": false
              }
          },
          "_id": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "property_1": {
            ".validate": "/* Insert custom data validation code here */"
          },
          ...
          "property_n": {
            ".validate": "/* Insert custom data validation code here */"
          }
        }
      },
      "specs" : {
        ".read": "auth.canAddSpecs || auth.canProcessTasks",
        ".write": "auth.canAddSpecs",
        "$specId": {
          ".validate": "newData.hasChild('in_progress_state')",
          "start_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "in_progress_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "finished_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "error_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "timeout": {
            ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && newData.val() > 0"
          },
          "$other": {
            ".validate": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Defining Specs (Optional)

#### Default Spec

A default spec configuration is assumed if no specs are specified in the `specs` subtree of the queue. The default spec has the following characteristics:

```js
{
  "default_spec": {
    "start_state": null,
    "in_progress_state": "in_progress",
    "finished_state": null,
    "error_state": "error",
    "timeout": 300000, // 5 minutes
    "retries": 0 // don't retry
  }
}
```

- `start_state` - The default spec has no `start_state`, which means any task pushed into the `tasks` subtree without a `_state` key will be picked up by default spec workers. If `start_state` is specified, only tasks with that `_state` may be claimed by the worker.
- `in_progress_state` - When a worker picks up a task and begins processing it, it will change the tasks's `_state` to the value of `in_progress_state`. This is the only required spec property, and it cannot equal the `start_state`, `finished_state`, or `error_state`. The `in_progress_state` is important for timeouts. If a timeout occurs on the specific task, any worker defined with the `in_progress_state` in question will try to pick it up and reset it to its own `start_state`. That means it is important that `in_progress_state` is unique, unless you want other workers to pick it up when it times out
- `finished_state` - The default spec has no `finished_state` so the worker will remove tasks from the queue upon successful completion. If `finished_state` is specified, then the task's `_state` value will be updated to the `finished_state` upon task completion. Setting this value to another spec's `start_state` is useful for chaining tasks together to create a job. It's possible to override the `finished_state` on a per-task basis by setting the `_new_state` key of the object passed into `resolve()` to a string to set the `_state` explicitly, `null` to remove the `_state` so it gets picked up by any spec without a `start_state`, or `false` to remove the task from the queue.
- `error_state` - If the task gets rejected the `_state` will be updated to this value and an additional key `_error_details` will be populated with the `previous_state` and an optional error message from the `reject()` callback. If this isn't specified, it defaults to "error". This can be useful for specifying different error states for different tasks, or chaining errors so that they can be logged.
- `timeout` - The default timeout is 5 minutes. When a task has been claimed by a worker but has not completed within `timeout` milliseconds, the queue will report that task as timed out, and reset that task to be claimable once again. If this is not specified, a task claimed by a worker could be orphaned and left in an unclaimable state if the worker processing it dies before the task is resolved or rejected.
- `retries` - The default spec doesn't retry failed tasks. When a task fails, if there are any remaining attempts, the queue will restart the task by setting the task's `_state` to its spec's `start_state`.

#### Creating Jobs using Custom Specs and Task Chaining

In order to use a job specification other than the default, the specification must be defined in the Firebase under the `specs` subtree. This allows us to coordinate job specification changes between workers and enforce expected behavior with Firebase security rules.

In this example, we're chaining three specs to make a job. New tasks pushed onto the queue without a `_state` key will be picked up by "spec_1" and go into the `spec_1_in_progress` state. Once "spec_1" completes and the task goes into the `spec_1_finished` state, "spec_2" takes over and puts it into the `spec_2_in_progress` state. Again, once "spec_2" completes and the task goes into the `spec_2_finished` state, "spec_3" takes over and puts it into the `spec_3_in_progress` state. Finally, "spec_3" removes it once complete. If, during any stage in the process there's an error, the task will end up in an "error" state.

```
queue
  - specs
```
```json
{
  "spec_1": {
    "in_progress_state": "spec_1_in_progress",
    "finished_state": "spec_1_finished",
    "timeout": 5000
  },
  "spec_2": {
    "start_state": "spec_1_finished",
    "in_progress_state": "spec_2_in_progress",
    "finished_state": "spec_2_finished",
    "timeout" : 20000
  },
  "spec_3": {
    "start_state": "spec_2_finished",
    "in_progress_state": "spec_3_in_progress",
    "timeout": 3000
  }
}
```


## Graceful Shutdown

Once initialized, a queue can be gracefully shutdown by calling its `shutdown()` function. This prevents workers from claiming new tasks, removes all Firebase listeners, and waits until all the current tasks have been completed before resolving the RSVP.Promise returned by the function.

By intercepting for the `SIGINT` termination signal like this, you can ensure the queue shuts down gracefully so you don't have to rely on the jobs timing out and being picked up by another worker:

```js
...
var queue = new Queue(ref, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  ...
});

process.on('SIGINT', function() {
  console.log('Starting queue shutdown');
  queue.shutdown().then(function() {
    console.log('Finished queue shutdown');
    process.exit(0);
  });
});
```


## Dynamic Worker Count

The number of workers running simultaneously in the same node.js thread can be managed dynamically using the following three methods on the instantiated Queue object:

- `getWorkerCount()` - This method returns the current number of workers on a queue.
- `addWorker()` - This method instantiates a new worker with the queue's current specs.
- `shutdownWorker()` - This method gracefully shuts down a worker and returns a promise fulfilled when shutdown. If there are no more workers to shutdown, the promise will be rejected.


## Message Sanitization, Revisited

In our example at the beginning, you wanted to perform several actions on your chat system:
  1. Sanitize chat message input
  2. Fan data out to multiple rooms and users

Together, these two actions form a job, and you can use custom specs, as shown above, to define the flow of tasks in this job. When you start, your Firebase should look like this:

```
root
  - queue
    - specs
      - sanitize_message
        - in_progress_state: "sanitize_message_in_progress"
        - finished_state: "sanitize_message_finished"
      - fanout_message
        - start_state: "sanitize_message_finished"
        - in_progress_state: "fanout_message_in_progress"
        - error_state: "fanout_message_failed"
        - retries: 3
    - tasks
      /* null, no data */
```

Let's imagine that you have some front end that allows your users to write their name and a message, and send that to your queue as it's `data`. Let's assume your user writes something like the following:

```js
// Using the web JavaScript client
var tasksRef = firebase.database().ref('queue/tasks');
tasksRef.push({
  'message': 'Hello Firebase Queue Users!',
  'name': 'Chris'
});
```

Your Firebase database should now look like this:

```
root
  - queue
    - specs
      /* same as above */
    - tasks
      - $taskId
        - message: "Hello Firebase Queue Users!"
        - name: "Chris"
```

When your users push `data` like the above into the `tasks` subtree, tasks will initially start in the `sanitize_message` spec because the task has no `start_state`. The associated queue can be specified using the following processing function:

```js
// chat_message_sanitization.js

var Queue = require('firebase-queue');
var admin = require('firebase-admin');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert('path/to/serviceAccountCredentials.json'),
  databaseURL: '<your-database-url>'
});

var db = admin.database();
var queueRef = db.ref('queue');
var messagesRef = db.ref('messages');

var options = {
  'specId': 'sanitize_message'
};
var sanitizeQueue = new Queue(queueRef, options, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  // sanitize input message
  data.message = sanitize(data.message);

  // pass sanitized message and username along to be fanned out
  resolve(data);
});

...
```

The queue worker will take this task, begin to process it, and update the reserved keys of the task:

```
root
  - queue
    - specs
      /* same as above */
    - tasks
      - $taskId
        - _owner: $workerUid
        - _progress: 0
        - _state: "sanitize_message_in_progress"
        - _state_changed: 1431475215737
        - _id: $taskId
        - message: "Hello Firebase Queue Users!"
        - name: "Chris"
```

Once the message is sanitized, it will be resolved and both the reserved keys and the data will be updated in the task (imagine for a minute that queue is a blacklisted word):

```
root
  - queue
    - specs
      /* same as above */
    - tasks
      - $taskId
        - _owner: null
        - _progress: 100
        - _state: "sanitize_message_finished"
        - _state_changed: 1431475215918
        - _id: $taskId
        - message: "Hello Firebase ***** Users!"
        - name: "Chris"
```

Now, you want to fan the data out to the `messages` subtree of your Firebase database, using the spec, `fanout_message`, so you can set up a second processing function to find tasks whose `_state` is `sanitize_message_finished`:

```js
...

var options = {
  'specId': 'fanout_message',
  'numWorkers': 5
};
var fanoutQueue = new Queue(queueRef, options, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  // fan data out to /messages; ensure that errors are caught and cause the task to fail
  messagesRef.push(data, function(error){
    if (error) {
      reject(error.message);
    } else {
      resolve(data);
    }
  });
});
```

Since there is no `finished_state` in the `fanout_message` spec, the task will be purged from the queue after the data is fanned out to the messages node. If the `push` fails for some reason, the task will fail and retry, a maximum of three times (as specified in our spec).

While this example is a little contrived since you could perform the sanitization and fanout in a single task, creating multiple specs for our tasks allows us to do things like add selective retries to certain tasks more likely to fail, put additional workers on more expensive tasks, or add expressive error states.


## Custom references to tasks and specs

It is possible to specify the locations the queue uses for tasks and the specs explicitly instead of using the defaults. To do this, simply pass an object to the Queue constructor in place of the Firebase reference; this object must contain the keys `tasksRef` and `specsRef`, and each value must be a Firebase reference.

```js
var Queue = require('firebase-queue');
var admin = require('firebase-admin');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert('path/to/serviceAccountCredentials.json'),
  databaseURL: '<your-database-url>'
});

var db = admin.database();

var jobsRef = db.ref('jobs');
var specsRef = db.ref('specs');

var queue = new Queue({ tasksRef: jobsRef, specsRef: specsRef }, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  // process task
});
```

## Wrap Up
