# Firebase Queue

A fault-tolerant, multi-worker, multi-stage job pipeline built on Firebase.


## Purpose of a Queue

Queues in Firebase can be used to perform privileged background work on data stored in a Firebase: generating thumbnails of images, filtering message contents and censoring data, or fanning data out to other locations in your Firebase. First, let's define a few terms we'll use when talking about a queue:
  - `task` - a piece of work that a queue worker can process
  - `spec` - a definition of an operation that the queue will perform on matching tasks
  - `job` - one of more `spec`'s that specify a series of ordered operations to be performed
  - `worker` - an individual process that picks up tasks with a certain spec and processes them

Let's take a look at a simple example to see how this works. Imagine you wanted to build a chat application that does two things:
  1. Sanitize chat message input
  2. Fan data out to multiple rooms and users

Using Firebase Queue, you can create specs for each of these tasks, and then use queue's to process the individual tasks to complete the job. We'll explore the queue, adding tasks, assigning workers, and creating custom specs to create full jobs, then revisit the example above.

## The Queue in Firebase

The queue relies on having a Firebase reference to coordinate workers e.g. `https://<your-firebase>.firebaseio.com/queue`. This queue can be stored at any path in your Firebase, and you can have multiple queues as well. The queue will respond to items pushed onto the `tasks` subtree and optionally read specifications from a `specs` subtree.
```
queue
  -> specs
  -> tasks
```


## Queue Workers

The basic unit of the Queue is the queue worker: the process that claims a task, performs the appropriate processing on the data, and either returns the transformed data, or an appropriate error.

You can start a worker process by passing in a Firebase [`ref`](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/understanding-data.html#section-creating-references) along with a processing function ([described below](#the-processing-function)), as follows:

```js
// my_queue_worker.js

var Queue = require('firebase-queue'),
    Firebase = require('firebase');

var ref = new Firebase('https://<your-firebase>.firebaseio.com/queue');
var queue = new Queue(ref, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  // Read and process item data
  console.log(data);

  // Do some work
  progress(50);

  // Finish the job asynchronously
  setTimeout(function() {
    resolve();
  }, 1000);
});
```

```shell
node my_queue_worker.js
```

Multiple queue workers can be initialized on multiple machines and Firebase-Queue will ensure that only one worker is processing a single queue item at a time.


#### Queue Worker Options (Optional)

Queue workers can take an optional options object to specify:
  - `specId` - specifies the spec type for this worker. This is important when creating multiple specs. Defaults to `null`, or the default spec.
  - `numWorkers` - specifies the number of workers to run simultaneously for this node.js thread. Defaults to 1 worker.
  - `sanitize` - specifies whether the `data` object passed to the processing function is sanitized of internal keys reserved for use by the queue. Defaults to `true`.

```js
...

var options = {
  'jobId': 'job_1',
  'numWorkers': 5,
  'sanitize': false
};
var queue = new Queue(ref, options, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  ...
});
```


## Pushing Tasks Onto the Queue

Using any Firebase client or the REST API, push an object with some data to the `tasks` subtree of your queue. Queue workers listening on that subtree will automatically pick up and process the new task.

```shell
# Using curl in shell
curl -X POST -d '{"foo": "bar"}' https://<your-firebase>.firebaseio.com/queue/tasks.json
```
or
```js
// Firebase Javascript Client
var Firebase = require('firebase');

var ref = new Firebase('https://<your-firebase>.firebaseio.com/queue/tasks');
ref.push({'foo':'bar'});
```

### Starting Tasks in Specific States (Optional)

When using a custom spec, you can pass a `_state` key in with your object, which will allow a custom spec's worker(s) to pick up your task further down the job pipeline, rather than starting at the starting spec.

```json
{
  'foo':'bar',
  'boo':'baz', 
  '_state':'spec_n_start'
}
```


## The Processing Function

The processing function provides the body of the data transformation, and allows for completing tasks successfully or with error conditions, as well as reporting the progress of a task. As this function defines the work that the worker must do, this callback function is required. It should take the following four parameters:

#### `data`

A JavaScript object containing the claimed task's data, and can contain any keys and values with the exception of several reserved keys, which are used for tracking worker progress.

The reserved keys are:
 - `_state` - The current state of the task. Will always be the task's `in_progress_state` when passed to the processing function.
 - `_state_changed` - The timestamp that the task changed into its current state. This will always be close to the time the processing function was called.
 - `_owner` - A unique ID for the worker and task number combination to ensure only one worker is responsible for the item at any time.
 - `_progress` - A number between 0 and 100, reset at the start of each task to 0.
 - `_error_details` - An object optionally present, containing the error details from a previous task execution. If present, it will contain a `previous_state` string capturing the state the task was in when it errored, and an optional `error` string from the `reject()` callback of the previous task. TODO: attempts

 By default the data is sanitized of these keys, but you can disable this behavior by setting `'sanitize': false` in the ([queue options](#queue-worker-options)).

#### `progress()`

A callback function for reporting the progress of the task. `progress()` takes a single parameter that must be a number between 0 and 100, and returns a [RSVP.Promise](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js) that's fulfilled when successfully updated. If this promise is rejected, it's likely that the task is no longer owned by this process (perhaps it has timed out or the task specification has changed) or the worker has lost its connection to Firebase.

By catching when this call fails and cancelling the current task early, the worker can minimize the extra work it does and return to processing new queue items sooner:

```js
...
var queue = new Queue(ref, options, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  ...
  function stopProcessing() {
    ...
  }
  ...
  // report current progress
  progress(currentProgress).catch(function(error) {
    // we've lost the current queue item, so stop processing
    stopProcessing();

    // and reject the item so that we can pick up new items
    reject(error);
  });
  ...
});
```

#### `resolve()`

A callback function for reporting that the current item has been completed and the worker is ready to process another item. If the current job specification has a `finished_state`, any plain JavaScript object passed into the `resolve()` function will be written to the queue item location and will be available to the next job if the jobs are chained.

#### `reject()`

A callback function for reporting that the current item failed and the worker is ready to process another item. Once this is called, the item will go into the `error_state` for the job with an additional `_error_details` object containing a `previous_state` key referencing this task's `in_progress_state`. If a string is passed into the `reject()` function, the `_error_details` will also contain an `error` key containing that string.

## Queue Security

Securing your queue is an important step in securely processing events that come in. Below is a sample set of security rules that can be tailored to your particular use case.

In this example, there are three categories of users, represented using fields of a [custom token](https://www.firebase.com/docs/rest/guide/user-auth.html):
- `auth.canAddTasks`: Users who can add tasks to the queue (could be an authenticated client or a secure server)
- `auth.canProcessTasks`: Users who can process tasks (usually on a secure server)
- `auth.canAddSpecs`: Users who can create and view job specifications (usually on a secure server)

These don't have to use a custom token, for instance you could use `auth!=null` in place of `auth.canAddTasks` if application's users can write directly to the queue. Similarly, `auth.canProcessTasks` and `auth.canAddSpecs` could be `auth.admin === true` if a single trusted server process was used to perform queue jobs.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "queue": {
      "tasks": {
        ".read": "auth.canProcessTasks",
        ".write": "auth.canAddTasks || auth.canProcessTasks",
        ".indexOn": "_state",
        "$taskId": {
          ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['property_1', ..., 'property_n']) || (auth.canProcessTasks && newData.hasChildren(['_state', '_state_changed', '_progress']))",
          "_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "_state_changed": {
            ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && (newData.val() === now || data.val() === newData.val())"
          },
          "_owner": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "_progress": {
            ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && newData.val() >= 0 && newData.val() <= 100"
          },
          "_error_details": {
              "error": {
                ".validate": "newData.isString()"
              },
              "previous_state": {
                ".validate": "newData.isString()"
              },
              "original_task": {
                /* This space intentionally left blank, prevents $other from matching on malformed task */
              },
              "attempts": {
                ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && newData.val() > 0"
              }
              "$other": {
                ".validate": false
              }
          },
          "property_1": {
            ".validate": "/* Insert custom data validation code here */"
          },
          ...
          "property_n": {
            ".validate": "/* Insert custom data validation code here */"
          }
        }
      },
      "specs" : {
        ".read": "auth.canAddSpecs || auth.canProcessTasks",
        ".write": "auth.canAddSpecs",
        "$specId": {
          ".validate": "newData.hasChild('in_progress_state')",
          "start_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "in_progress_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "finished_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "error_state": {
            ".validate": "newData.isString()"
          },
          "timeout": {
            ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && newData.val() > 0"
          },
          "$other": {
            ".validate": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Defining Specs (Optional)

#### Default Spec

A default spec configuration is assumed if no specs are specified in the `specs` subtree of the queue. The default spec has the following characteristics:

```json
{
  "default_spec": {
    "start_state": null,
    "in_progress_state": "in_progress",
    "finished_state": null,
    "error_state": "error",
    "timeout": 300000, // 5 minutes
    "retries": 0 // don't retry
  }
}
```

- `start_state` - The default spec has no `start_state`, which means any task pushed into the `tasks` subtree without a `_state` key will be picked up by default spec workers. If `start_state` is specified, only tasks with that `_state` may be claimed by the worker.
- `in_progress_state` - When a worker picks up a task and begins processing it, it will change the tasks's `_state` to the value of `in_progress_state`. This is the only required spec property, and it cannot equal the `start_state`, `finished_state`, or `error_state`.
- `finished_state` - The default spec has no `finished_state` so the worker will remove tasks from the queue upon successful completion. If `finished_state` is specified, then the task's `_state` value will be updated to the `finished_state` upon task completion. Setting this value to another spec's `start_state` is useful for chaining tasks together to create a job.
- `error_state` - If the task gets rejected the `_state` will be updated to this value and an additional key `_error_details` will be populated with the `previousState` and an optional error message from the `reject()` callback. If this isn't specified, it defaults to "error". This can be useful for specifying different error states for different tasks, or chaining errors so that they can be logged.
- `timeout` - The default timeout is 5 minutes. When a task has been claimed by a worker but has not completed within `timeout` milliseconds, the queue will report that task as timed out, and reset that task to be claimable once again. If this is not specified a task will be claimed at most once and never leave that state if the worker processing it fails during the process.
- `retries` - The default spec doesn't retry failed tasks

#### Creating Jobs using Custom Specs and Task Chaining

In order to use a job specification other than the default, the specification must be defined in the Firebase under the `specs` subtree. This allows us to coordinate job specification changes between workers and enforce expected behavior with Firebase security rules.

In this example, we're chaining three specs to make a job. New items pushed onto the queue without a `_state` key will be picked up by "spec_1" and go into the `spec_1_in_progress` state. Once "spec_1" completes and the item goes into the `spec_1_finished` state, "spec_2" takes over and puts it into the `spec_2_in_progress` state. Again, once "spec_2" completes and the item goes into the `spec_2_finished` state, "spec_3" takes over and puts it into the `spec_3_in_progress` state. Finally, "spec_3" removes it once complete. If, during any stage in the process there's an error, the item will end up in an "error" state.

```
queue
  -> specs
```
```json
{
  "spec_1": {
    "in_progress_state": "spec_1_in_progress",
    "finished_state": "spec_1_finished",
    "timeout": 5000
  },
  "spec_2": {
    "start_state": "spec_1_finished",
    "in_progress_state": "spec_2_in_progress",
    "finished_state": "spec_2_finished",
    "timeout" : 20000
  },
  "spec_3": {
    "start_state": "spec_2_finished",
    "in_progress_state": "spec_3_in_progress",
    "timeout": 3000
  }
}
```

## Message Sanitization, Revisited

In our example at the beginning, we wanted to perform several actions on our chat system:
  1. Sanitize chat message input
  2. Fan data out to multiple rooms and users

Together, these two actions form a job, and we can use custom specs to define the flow of tasks in our job:

```
queue
  -> specs
```
```json
{
  "sanitize_message": {
    "in_progress_state": "sanitize_message_in_progress",
    "finished_state": "sanitize_message_finished",
  },
  "fanout_message": {
    "start_state": "sanitize_message_finished",
    "in_progress_state": "fanout_message_in_progress",
    "error_state": "fanout_message_failed",
    "retries": 3
  }
}
```

When we push our `data` into the `tasks` subtree, all tasks will start in the `sanitize_message` spec, which we can specify using the following processing function:

```js
// chat_message_sanitization.js

var Queue = require('firebase-queue'),
    Firebase = require('firebase');

var ref = new Firebase('https://<your-firebase>.firebaseio.com');
var queueRef = ref.child('queue');
var messagesRef = ref.child('messages');

var sanitizeQueue = new Queue(queueRef, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  // sanitize input data
  var sanitizedData = sanitize(data);

  // pass sanitized data along to be fanned out
  resolve(sanitizedData);
});

...
```

Once the message is sanitized, we want to fan the data out to the `messages` subtree of our firebase, using the spec, `fanout_message`:

```js
...

var options = {'specId':'sanitize_message_finished'}
var fanoutQueue = new Queue(queueRef, options, function(data, progress, resolve, reject) {
  // fan data out to /messages, ensure that Firebase errors are caught and cause the task to fail
  messagesRef.push(data, function(error){
    if (error) {
      reject(error);
    } else {
      resolve(data);
    }
  });
});
```
